# EmploymentClassification
This repository has 
1. A description of each entity class and relationship. These should total twenty, and should include at least five of each. Entity class descriptions should include 3-4 sentences that make clear exactly what individuals belong to the class. Include at least two properties or attributes that include the class in their domain. Relationship descriptions should include a 1-3 sentence description of the relationship and explanations of the arity, cardinality, domain, and codomain of the relationship.
2. A two page discussion of your group's rationale and justification for deciding these twenty are the most important for the system's success. This should be a summary, based on discussions within your group. As a guideline, aim to devote one paragraph to each important controversy that arose or decision that you made. To those add one paragraph at the beginning about what you decided and one at the end about the experience of conducting this analysis as a group.
