Group Rationale:

As part of the Group Assignment 3: 
Inference using Datalog, we were assigned to work on Group 3’s Employment Classification Graph models. The condition given involved to identify, whether an intern employee at Harvard is a student or a part time employee depending on the number of hours and the term he/she is enrolled. The group activity to be done was divided among the group members as per the requirement given by the Professor in the question statement. The tasks that each person conducted is as mentioned below.

The group work started with the design of the UML diagram where we confused at start whether we have to work only on the part mentioned or the entire thing. After the discussion it was clear to us that we have to work only on the condition given by the professor in the question statement. Once, we started working on it there were many ideas from each group member and it was difficult to select one. We decided to classify the student’s employment based on the term that he will be enrolled and also as per the hours he is eligible to work. This was our first step towards the assignment and we finalized this approach and implemented this in the UML and similarly the instance diagram was modified.

While working on the assignment we faced many issues and the main issue was with the Datalog/ DES software to work with. We reviewed the lecture again and again but some parts about processing the code in the machine was something we couldn’t figure out and were stuck there. We met two TA’s but both of the TA’s were unable to help and we somewhere lacked to understand the issues in our code. But we tried till the end and came up with the output. Another major issue was time and due to the spring break the time coordination and communication was not that good.
