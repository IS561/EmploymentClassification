For group assignment 3, we worked together to finish the five deliverables. Before beginning to reexamine its outlines, we read through all the documents of Group 2 to pick up a diagram on the framework purposes and elements that are included. Next, we audited the UML chart and RDF graph of Group 2 to comprehend their translation of the situation. As per assignment instruction, we made changes on the UML outline based on our comprehension, and we included essential entity classes and comparing connections to more readily mirror the inductions referenced in the task. At last, we draw the RDF chart dependent on the changed UML graph, and we wrote our Datalog code to test our presumptions on the inductions until the results that were obtained correctly reflected our expectations.
