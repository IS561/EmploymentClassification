# RATIONALE AND JUSTIFICATION
## Group 3:
* Jiang Chang
* David Chanthabandith
* Sayantan Dutta
* Pujeethaa Jakka
* Yi (Joy) Liang
* Saxue Wang

In this group assignment, we worked on creating a revised description of each entity class and relationship, a schema level UML class diagram that includes all entity classes and relationships and an instance level SVG  following RDF diagrammatic conventions. For this assignment, we had four meetings in total. 

In the first online meeting, we decided the specific division of work and the deadline for each part. We began our revisions to our model by first reading through the Professor’s comments and what our fellow classmates wrote to get an idea of what is or isn’t clear within our entity and relationship descriptions. We all participated in Google Hangout sessions and in-person discussions to discuss all the entities and relationships in detail. We tried to determine if there were any ones that we had a strong opinion on and address them as they came up. Before the second meeting, we broke down our group into two smaller groups. We first went over the feedback received from the professor and group-1, so that we get clarity about what kind of entity classes and relationships can help determine the type of employment. 

The first major revision we made in our documents was our distinction of employment position versus employment type. Both the Professor, and our peers determined that this distinction wasn't clear, and we implemented these changes. There was confusion and argument whether to include entity class Appointment. In the beginning, we thought it was blurry between appointment and employment position. The employment position consists of the relationship between two parties; one being the employer and the other is the employee. Employment type relates to the classification of employment that an employee may fall under categories like regular employment, temporary employment etc. The feedback we received from the peer reviews were discussed within the group and we decided on altering our way of thought to better explain the relationships we had in our employment classification scenario. Finally, we agreed that there is value in differentiating employment position and appointment. We used the same type of methodology to go through our existing entities and relationships to determine what is necessary. If the entity or relationship did not help us determine what the employment type of an employee was then we would omit it. 

Once we finalized the entities and relationships, we moved on to draw the UML. First, we drew nine rectangles to represent our entity classes, our scenario is determining which employment categories an employee at Harvard belongs to, so we centered the employee so that we can make our diagram well-structured. Then we drew the solid lines to connect two classes which represent the relationship between them, the arrow points to the codomain, the number beside the rectangles represents the cardinality. After we finished the UML, we developed an even better understanding about our system, we realized some problems about the relationship between Employee and Co-op & Intern Program, so we fixed it by adding a new relationship between Student and Co-op & Intern Program.

Then we moved on to develop an instance level SVG. In this SVG we illustrate the instance level representation of the scenario where given an employee’s detail, the HR tries to find to which of the 7 employment types the employee belongs to. We start off with taking the employee for instance – “employee A” and find out that employee A is also a student, is part of an intern program (the student can be from Harvard or any other university too). Since employee A is a student, from the student entity’s university attribute, it can be confirmed that the student is from Harvard University and hence this determines that the employee A’s employment type is “STUDENT EMPLOYMENT”. It is also understood that every employee has only one employment type associated with them. Since the employee A is managed by department X alone, the scenario of “CONCURRENT EMPLOYMENT” is ruled out. Here we are considering 5 entity classes – Policy, Department, Student, Co-Op and Internship program, Employment type. When a student becomes a university employee, he must adhere to specific employee policy which belongs to the entity class of Policy. 

In this group assignment, we had four meetings totally. In the first online meeting, we decided the specific division of work and the deadline of each part of missions. During this meeting, we decided to divide into two groups and revise assignment 1 at the same time. And then we compared them and made a final version in the next online meeting. After divided into two groups, three of us organized an offline meeting to revise the first assignment according to the feedback the professor gave us. It was so efficient that it took us less than an hour to finish it. However, the second online meeting proved to be time-consuming to finalize the new set of entities and relationships. We decided to finish the remaining two charts by an in-person meeting with five members and Joy joined online through google hangouts from Chicago. Despite the relative simplicity of UML diagrams and the fact that we spent more time working out what RDF diagrams were, this offline meeting was more efficient than expected. At the end of the assignment, we felt that we should conduct all future meetings offline because face-to-face communication proved to be a lot more efficient and effective.
