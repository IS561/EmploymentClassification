In this group assignment, we worked on creating a revised description of each entity class and relationship, a schema level UML class diagram that includes all entity classes and relationships and an instance level SVG  following RDF diagrammatic conventions. For this assignment, we had four meetings in total. In this diagram we illustrate the instance level representation of the scenario where given an employee’s detail, the HR tries to find to which of the 7 employment types the employee belongs to. We start off with taking the employee for instance – “employee A” and find out that employee A is also a student, is part of an intern program (the student can be from Harvard or any other university too). Since employee A is a student, from the student entity’s university attribute, it can be confirmed that the student is from Harvard University and hence this determines that the employee A’s employment type is “STUDENT EMPLOYMENT”. It is also understood that every employee has only one employment type associated with them. Since the employee A is managed by department X alone, the scenario of “CONCURRENT EMPLOYMENT”. Finally, employee A adheres to the policy imposed on him/her. Here we are considering 5 entity classes – Policy, Department, Student, Co-Op and Internship program, Employment type. When a student becomes a university employee, he must adhere to specific employee policy which belongs to the entity class of Policy. A student as an instance comes under Student entity class. When a student becomes an employee, it is related to instance Student Employment coming under entity class Employment type. A student employee is managed by a specific department which hires/manages him which itself comes under the entity class Department. A student when hired also becomes a part of the internship/Co-op program and hence is related to the specific instance of an internship program which is related to entity class Co-Op and Internship program. Here an inherent assumption has been made that any student employment is either an internship or Co-Op program. 

In the first online meeting, we decided the specific division of work and the deadline of each part of missions. We began our revisions to our model by first reading through the Professor’s comments and what our fellow classmates wrote to get an idea of what is or isn’t clear within our entity and relationship descriptions. We all participated in Google Hangout sessions and in-person discussions to discuss all the entities and relationships in detail. We tried to determine if there were any ones that we had a strong opinion on and address them as they came up. Before the second meeting, we broke down our group into two smaller groups. We first went over the feedback received from the professor and group-1, so that we get clarity about what kind of entity classes and relationships can help determine the type of employment. 

The first major revision we changed in our documents was our distinction of employment position versus employment type. Both the Professor, and our peers determined that this distinction wasn't clear, and we implemented these changes. There was confusion and argument whether to include entity class Appointment. In the beginning, we thought it was blurry between appointment and employment position. The employment position consists of the relationship between two parties; one being the employer and the other is the employee. Employment type relates to the classification of employment that an employee may fall under and is usually based on an HR policy that would dictate the type of employment that the employee has. Some of the feedback we received from the peer reviews were discussed within the group and we decided on altering our way of thought to better explain the relationships we had in our employment classification scenario. Finally, we agreed that there is value in differentiating employment position and appointment. We used the same type of methodology to go through our existing entities and relationships to determine what is necessary. If the entity or relationship did not help us determine what the employment type of an employee was then we would omit it. After we finished the UML diagram, we had a more clear understanding about our system, we realized some problems about the relationship between Employee and Co-op & Intern Program, so we fixed it by adding a new relationship between Student and Co-op & Intern Program. 

At the end of the assignment, we realized that offline meetings resulted in more effective output than online meetings.
Even though online meetings has its advantage of time flexibility, but in face-to-face interaction, to-and-fro communication is more organized and more efficient.
